### Group Project Write Up

#### Group Portion

1. **List the members of your group and what your interest was (e.g., art, STEM,
   doctrinal).**
   
   Our interest was STEM. Our group included Dallin Johnson, Matthew Jenkins,
   Nathan Ludlow, Brendon Bown, and Josh Coombs.


2. **Describe the project your group chose and how you carried it out.**
   
   We choose to grow mustard seeds and research agriculture and its appearance
   in the New Testament. We decided to take what we learned from the experience
   of growing mustard seeds using both modern and ancient techniques and then
   work to obtain a deeper understanding of how Christ's parables can be
   understood and applied based on the agriculture and history of mustard. We
   spent time during the semester growing the seeds with both modern and ancient
   techniques and researching the historicity and agriculture of mustard seeds
   to be able to have a presentation ready to present.


3. **Evaluate your effectiveness in carrying out the project on a scale from
   1-10: did you do what you had planned to do and consistently keep up with
   it?**
   
   On a scale of 1-10 we determined that our effectiveness is about an 8. We did
   what we planned to do and accomplished it in the timeframe and learned more
   about the New Testament and its impact in our lives. There was still room for
   improvement though and we could have spent more time working together to
   learn rather than independently and we are sure there is more that we could
   have learned. But we did accomplish what we wanted.


4. **What kind of time commitment did your project entail?**
   
   Most of the mustard plants took 2 weeks to grow, but the larger plants took 2
   months to grow. Along with the growth of the mustard seeds, we had to spend
   time researching the hebraic references and culture about the mustard seed,
   as well as the agricultural customs of the time. We also spent time preparing
   and practicing for the presentation and final. Overall it averages out to a
   commitment of about 2 hours a week in work.


5. **Learning Objectives: Explain what specific aspect(s) of the course content
   you mastered through this project. What did the project help you understand
   better about the Gospels and/or Jesus Christ?**
   
   The specific aspects of the course content that we mastered was the idea of
   being able to understand and apply parables by using exegesis to understand
   what it meant to those people, then at that time, and then thinking about how
   it can apply to us, today in our time based on knowing what it meant to those
   people them. The project helped us understand just how important it is to
   understand the historical culture of the people at the time where we are
   reading in the scriptures because otherwise we may miss the true meaning of
   the scriptures. We learned that not only does the mustard seed growing have
   references to the growth of the church but the parables also have references
   to the custom of mixtures and it shows that not only did Christ say the
   church would grow, but that it would grow by having a mixture of people
   joining together. People of different lands, cultures, and backgrounds, Jews
   and Gentiles, saints and sinners and people from all over the world would
   have to come together to grow the church of God.


6. **Please upload your project through photos, a recording, a video, or the
   actual paper (for example, a piece of art, a written composition of music,
   poetry, a report, etc.).**

#### Individual Response

7. **What worked well or didn’t work so well in your group project? Do you feel
   that your group project was equal effort by all group members or did you have
   some issues with getting everyone’s participation?**
   
   I felt like there was equal participation by everyone for the most part. I
   was a little disappointed in our project. When I first started, I was hoping
   that I would be able to do some sort of coding for this project, but we
   weren't able to find a way to apply it, so it ended up just turning into
   another research project for me. I still learned some pretty cool things,
   though.
   
   I also was a little disappointed with our end result. It was very well
   put-together for having a limit of 2 pages. However, I feel like a lot of the
   work that was done was lost as we condensed the information. I spent three or
   four hours researching mixtures, but all that got into the paper were two
   paragraphs.
   
   Anyway, I learned a lot from the project. It wasn't my favorite, but then
   again, not every project can turn out perfectly. I still learned a lot of
   lessons. And I feel like we did a good job with the constraints that we had.

8. **How much of your project was collaborative with your group or done alone by
   yourself?**
   
   A lot of the research itself was done alone, with weekly check-ins for
   reports on progress. It was closer to the end when we began to put everything
   together that we worked more collaboratively, putting together and editing
   the slideshow and the report.

9. **Share some things you learned from fellow group members through your
   collaboration together.**
   
   I learned a lot about the mustard plant that I didn't know before. I was in a
   group with Dallin, who knows a lot about biology and botany. He had a lot of
   really cool insights, such as how plants don't just *receive* light, they
   grow *towards* it. This helped me to realize that we can't just be passively
   learning about God's word. We have to be actively trying to develop ourselves
   and "grow" in our application of the word of God. We have to "grow" towards
   Him, not just receive his word.

10. **Write about how the project was meaningful for you and what you learned
    through the project.**
	
	I learned a lot about mixtures. In the law of Moses, specifically in
    Leviticus 19:19, and again in Deuteronomy 22:9, the commandment is given to
    "not sow thy field with mingled seed". If one does so, "the fruit of thy
    seed which thou has sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, [will be]
    defiled". Thus, one cannot, for example, grow vegetables and wheat in the
    same field.

	There are, however, some plants that can be grown together. The most
    well-known example of this is wheat and tares. Tares, also known as "the
    bearded darnel", are a species of rye-grass whose seeds contain a strong
    poison. It bears a strong resemblance to wheat until the ear appears, at
    which point it is differentiable.

	This example was a well-known example in the time of Christ for teaching
    about the nature of mixtures, and it was likely that Christ was making
    reference in his parable of the wheat and the tares. Often, this parable is
    interpreted in the context of good and evil. God allows good and bad people
    to live together and interact. Sometimes the good suffer because of the
    bad. However, in the end, all of the good will enter into the kingdom of
    heaven while all of the evil will be burned. Thus everyone shall receive
    their recompense.

	While this may be a correct interpretation of the parable, those that
    listened to the parable may have seen it from a different perspective based
    on their knowledge of mixtures as taught by the Rabbis. Christ spoke of the
    kingdom of heaven in terms of a field. This field was sown with wheat, which
    was a good seed, and which the owner wanted. Then, the enemy came and sowed
    the field with tares, a potentially poisonous seed.

	At this point, some may have wanted to completely abandon the field, while
    others expressed their desire to immediately remove the tares from the
    field, possibly in order to avoid having a mixture of plants growing
    together and making the field impure.

	The wise owner, however, recognized that in the process of uprooting the
    tares, some of the wheat would be uprooted as well. He couldn't afford that
    to happen. He also recognizes the two crops as mixtures that can grow
    together. So instead he allows for the mixture to grow together until
    harvest time. It is at that moment that he has the two plants separated and
    dealt with accordingly.

	In this parable, God evidently is the owner of the field. He has sown seeds
    of love and charity in his church. Satan has also sown seeds of contention
    and malice. Because of this, some may want to completely abandon the
    church. Others, like the Pharisees of Jesus' time, may want to eliminate any
    sign of "impurity" at an early stage in order to avoid problems
    later. However, God, in his infinite wisdom, has chosen to let all grow
    together, recognizing that it will do more good than harm.

	The Pharisees were often judgemental of those that were not a member of the
    house of Israel. They looked down upon the Samaritan, for example, as
    demonstrated during Christ's interaction with the woman at the well (John
    4:9). If they were given charge over God's "field", they would have
    immediately shunned anyone that they thought was a "tare", someone that
    would not obtain a place in the kingdom of God. This meant that they would
    refuse to include anyone that was not directly of the house of Israel. They
    wanted to avoid any kind of "mixture". God, on the other hand, was willing
    to allow a mixture. He was willing to let both the Jews and the Gentiles
    into the covenant, as evidenced by the ministry of the apostles after
    Christ's death. Some of the Gentiles would end up being "wheat", while some
    of the Jews would turn out to be "tares". But that would not be evident
    until after they had shown their fruits. Thus, as a part of this parable,
    Christ was showing the importance of welcoming everyone into the kingdom of
    God. He showed that those of his church should not shun anyone. Otherwise,
    they might uproot a stalk of wheat because they thought it was a tare.

	In other words, God has permitted that there be a mixture in His church. It
    is only after they show their fruits that they shall be judged. And that
    judgment only comes from God or from those appointed by him. Only they have
    the revelation to know when the fruits are ripe.
	
	I also realized from my Old Testament class that there are some mixtures
    that God doesn't allow. He doesn't allow the mixture of the Israelites and
    the Canaanites, for example. He knows that that combination will result in
    Israel turning towards idolatry. And they do, because of their association
    with the Canaanites. God ultimately knows what mixtures will bring forth
    good fruit, and what mixtures will lead to a "poor harvest".


11. **Is there some aspect of this project that you could see yourself applying
    to your personal life?**
    
	In this project, I've learned a lot about judging others. On one hand, God
    has commanded us to not judge others. However, he has also said that we
    *can* judge others *with a righteous judgment*. These seem to be in conflict
    with each other. But in terms of mixtures, what I've learned is that the
    judgment can't come from me. I can't look at someone with prejudice, or
    judge someone based on their outward appearances. I should be constantly
    searching out Heavenly Father in prayer, asking Him to help me to understand
    those with whom I interact. And I need to be consulting the things that He
    has already said, both in the scriptures and in modern day
    revelation. Relying on Him and His spirit is evidently the best way to
    achieve the most optimal results, both for myself, and for others.
