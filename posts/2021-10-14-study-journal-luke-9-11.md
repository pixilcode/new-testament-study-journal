### Notes
  * **Luke 9:10-17** - Although Christ attempted
    to take his apostles "privately" into the
    desert, there were still a lot of people that
    followed him. However, instead of rejecting
    them and telling them to go away, he taught
    them. Then, at the end of teaching them, he
    also fed them. This is a great example of
    Christ's charity and compassion. Even though
    he *wanted* to be alone with his apostles, he
    took the time to share the word with those
    that were seeking it. Then, he took care of
    their temporal needs by feeding them. We
    should also be looking to serve others, even
    when it might be a little inconvenient for
    us.
	
	Also, when Christ distributes the bread and
    the fish, he doesn't just make it miraculously
    appear in front of everyone, though he no
    doubt could have. He allows his disciples to
    make use of their previous experience in
    working in the "food industry" and in civil
    services in order to organize the people and
    distribute the food. God could do everything
    by himself. But he allows us to use our
    talents to serve in the kingdom of God. This
    gives each of us the opportunity to serve and
    to learn and grow (see *Bible Gateway: God's
    Provision*).

  * **Luke 10:13** - Anyone can see miracles,
    anyone can receive a "sign". However, that
    isn't what will convert us. Our ground must be
    fertile, broken-up, clear of weeds, like in
    the parable of the sower, in order to be
    converted. Laman and Lemuel saw great
    miracles, they even saw an angel. However,
    their repentance was short-lived. They ended
    up rebelling against their brother and against
    God.

  * **Luke 10:38-42** - Christ is visiting Mary
    and Martha. Martha gets to work preparing the
    house for Jesus in order to welcome him. Mary,
    on the other hand, sits down at the feet of
    Jesus and listens to his word. When Martha
    complains about Mary not helping her to clean
    up and serve Jesus, Jesus gently corrects her,
    telling her that "Mary hath chosen that good
    part." Thus, we should be ensuring that we are
    spending our time in ways that will be most
    beneficial for us in the eternity.
	
	However, at the same time, Jesus does not tell
    Martha that what she is doing is wrong. The
    hospitality that Martha is showing is likely
    appreciated by the Savior. However, Martha's
    actions need to be grounded in her love for
    the Savior and his word (see *Bible Gateway:
    Mary and Martha*).
	
	In the same way, it's not a bad thing for us
    to participate in the world. We can go to
    work, go to school, and hang out with
    friends. However, it's important that we do
    everything "with an eye single to the glory of
    God." Work isn't bad, but we need to make sure
    that we are keeping the Sabbath day holy at
    the same time. Studying for school can help us
    to progress in life, but we need to ensure
    that we are studying the scriptures, too.

  * **Luke 11:28** - "Blessed are they that hear
    the word of God, *and keep it.*"
  
  * **Luke 11:34-36** - If your eye is single to
    the glory of God, your whole body will be
    filled with the light of Christ, with the Holy
    Ghost. You will be guided towards things of
    righteousness.
	
	On the other hand, if your eye is on other
    things, such as money or video games, then
    you can't be filled with light because money,
    video games, or other things of the world
    don't provide light. They suck it out.
