### Have you used your scripture journal with each bloc of reading in Matthew 8-16?
Yes

### What are two additional resources that have enhanced your study?
*Jesus the Christ* by James E. Talmage and
[scripture.byu.edu](scripture.byu.edu)

### Share one insight that you have gained from your scripture study and/or from the additional resource.
The story of the centurion really left an
impression on me. Sometimes in my life, I want a
sign. I want God to come down and resolve some
problem in my life so that I don't have to deal
with it any more. However, what I've learned from
the centurion is that, to be honest, I'm probably
not worthy enough to have God (or Jesus) come down
and resolve all the problems in my life. There
won't be a plain and visible resolution to my
problems. But I still need to have faith that
things will work out. Even if God isn't always
visibly present, solving everything for me, I need
to have faith like the centurion that He can take
care of things from the distance. Everything is
subject to his will. I just need to trust that
He's going to do what's best for me.

### How has this insight blessed your life or how have you applied what you learned?
In the last couple days, as I've reflected on this
principle, I've come to realize how much in my
life *just works out*. Sometimes, I worry that I
won't be able to finish everything. Just
yesterday, my day was so packed, my schedule was
so tight, that I didn't think I'd be able to
accomplish everything I needed to, such as
finishing my resume for the career fair, cleaning
up my apartment for the apartment check, and
preparing for the recruitment dinner that night. I
thought that somewhere, I'd slip up and things
would go wrong. But miraculously, everything
seemed to be timed just right. Throughout the day,
I was inspired to make certain adjustments to my
schedule. And because of that, everything fit
perfectly. To relate it to a story we discussed
today, I took a step onto the water, and I thought
"I can't do this. I *shouldn't* do this." But
Christ reached out and saved me, even in just the
day-to-day activities.
