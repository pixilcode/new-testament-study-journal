### Notes
  * **Mark 9:24** - "Lord, I believe; help thou my
    unbelief"
	1. Assert strengths first, then acknowledge
       limitations
	   * Hold fast to what you already know
         and stand strong until additional
         knowledge comes
	   * Like Adam and Eve: "Why do you
         sacrifice?" "No idea, the Lord told us
         to."
    2. Do not start your quest for faith by saying
       how much you do *not* have
	   * Don't pretend to have faith you don't
         have, but be true to the faith that you
         *do* have
       * Questions are okay, but don't let those
         questions stand in the way of faith
         working its miracle
    3. Do not be afraid to ask for help!
	   * When we have real intent, God is going to
         fulfill our desire to learn.
	   * He is going to send help from both sides
         of the veil.
  * **Mark 9:29** - In the KJV, it mentions both
    prayer *and* fasting; in the New Rendition, it
    mentions only prayer. Is this implying that
    fasting is a form of prayer?
  * **Mark 9:43-48** - Jesus teaches about the
    importance of an eternal perspective. It's
    better to suffer temporally (by losing a hand,
    foot, etc.) and enter into the kingdom of God
    than to be cast into hell with the body in
    perfect condition. Leave behind temporal
    things for spiritual things.
  * **Mark 10:35-45** - The greatest among
    everyone is those who serve. He who loves God
    and loves his neighbor is the greatest. The
    best way to lead others is to *show them
    love*. Some dictators try to force everyone to
    do their will. The best leaders don't need
    to. Everyone is willing to follow them through
    hellfire because they feel the love of this
    person for them and they trust this person
    with their very lives.
