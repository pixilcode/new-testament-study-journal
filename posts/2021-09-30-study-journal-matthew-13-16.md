### Notes
  * **The Parable of the Sower**
	* The seed was the same. It wasn't the seed
      that affected whether it grew or not. It was
      the condition of the soil.
    * Parables are not intended to give a complete
      explanation of a concept. They are intended
      to reveal certain aspects of a
      doctrine. Taking parables to the extreme
      will create an absurd definition of the
      parable.
  * **The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares**
	* Each of us is either a wheat seed or a tare
      seed. God can't remove the tares from the
      earth because he might accidentally uproot a
      wheat. God wants to give us time to grow and
      prove ourselves as wheat.
  * **The Parable of the Seed Growing Secretly**
    * Truth grows on its own. The processes of its
      growth are only known to God. The growth
      of truth doesn't require us to be
      constantly watching over it. As we plant
      seeds through missionary work, even if we
      don't have the opportunity to see it all
      the way through, we can have the faith
      that it will work out.
  * **The Parable of the Mustard Seed**
	* The kingdom of God isn't going to be
      something grand and glorious. It might even
      be "the least of all seeds". However, it can
      grow into a huge tree.
