### Notes
  * **John 8:3-8** - The response of Jesus to the
    intentionally inflammatory challenge was
    initially to not respond. He paused for a
    moment to consider his response, before giving
    a very clear and concise response that didn't
    encourage further conflict, but encouraged
    introspection. In the same way, we should be
    considering what we say and how it will
    influence others rather than just saying
    whatever comes off the top of our head. It's
    better to give a calm, thought-out response
    rather than a quick, fiery response. Also, in
    his response, he never denied the law. He
    simply put things into perspective. If they
    were going to execute the law so exactly, they
    that were prosecuting had to also be
    prosecuted. If they were going to offer mercy
    to themselves, they needed to offer mercy to
    the woman as well.
  * **John 8:37-39** - Your ancestry doesn't mean
    anything for your salvation. Everyone from the
    greatest kings to the lowliest beggars will
    have to be baptized for the remission of sins
    and receive the Holy Ghost. Just because
    you're a descendant of Abraham doesn't mean
    that you're bound for the Celestial Kingdom.
  * **John 9:40-41** - When we have a knowledge of
    something, we have a responsibility to use
    that knowledge in a righteous manner. Those
    that don't have a knowledge can't be held
    accountable for it.
  * **John 10:11-14** - Are we "hirelings" or are
    we "shepherds"? Are we there just as long as
    it pays off to be there? Do we stay just until
    the fun runs out? Or do we stay when adversity
    comes? Do we help others with their burdens
    and protect those that are being attacked
    spiritually, emotionally, or physically?
