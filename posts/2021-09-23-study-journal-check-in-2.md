This entry is the entry about the Sermon on the
Mount, which is probably my favorite reading so
far. As I was reading this, I learned so much from
it, even more than I was able to write down. There
are so many small gems of knowledge throughout
these chapters that have such simple (though
impactful) application in my life. From thoughts
about how to improve my relationship with others
to an analysis of the fruits that I'm producing, I
definitely felt the Spirit nudging me (or sometimes
slapping me upside the head) as I was reading
this.

I also enjoyed this chapter because of a couple of
connections that I made with what I'm learning in
my Old Testament class right now, such as when
Christ mentions taking oaths.

### Describe one additional resource that has enhanced your study and explain how.
One resource that has really enhanced my study
this week is *Jesus the Christ*. This book has
added a new perspective to the aspects of Christ's
life. Instead of using the traditional
interpretation of a story, Elder Talmage
introduces new ways to look at events in Christ's
life. One of the coolest things I've learned from
*Jesus the Christ* relates to Christ's 40 day
fast, or rather the temptation that comes
afterwards. I've always imagined that the
temptation that Satan extended simply involved
using heavenly power in a way that wasn't
right.

However, Elder Talmage points out that
there was a greater temptation: the temptation for
Christ to *prove* his divinity to himself, even
though he had just recently received a
confirmation of it from his Father at his
baptism. I've never thought about that side of the
temptation before. And it helped me to understand
how Satan uses doubt in order to get the children
of God to forget or disregard their spiritual
experiences. And it's reminded me of the
importance to record spiritual promptings so that
I never forget the "proof" that God is already
giving me.
