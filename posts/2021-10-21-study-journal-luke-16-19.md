### Notes
  * **Luke 16:1-12** - It would seem that this
    parable condones the actions and dishonesty of
    the unjust steward. However, the steward
    wasn't commended for his dishonesty, he was
    commended for his prudence and
    wisdom. (*Student Manual*) Thus, if he was so
    careful to prepare for his temporal future,
    how much more careful should we be as we
    prepare for our eternal future. Shouldn't we
    be taking action so that we have "friends" in
    heaven that will be ready to welcome us in?
  * **Luke 16:13-18** - The rich man and Lazarus
    both had the opportunity to go to heaven. It
    isn't that the rich can't go to heaven or that
    the poor will always go to heaven. However,
    because of the way that the rich man acted
    during his life, even all his riches couldn't
    save him. It's important that we learn to use
    our temporal resources wisely so that we can
    attain the kingdom of Heaven.
  * **Luke 18:1-8** - In this parable, we learn a
    lot about how we need to be persistent in
    asking God for help. If we are persistent, we
    show how important that for which we are
    asking is important to us. We need to
    persevere, even when it seems hopeless, with
    the faith that God hears our cries. As we do,
    He will exhaust our prayers. (*Student
    Manual*)
	
	Also, interestingly enough, we get to learn
    about God and his perfection as he compares it
    to the imperfect tendencies of the natural
    man. We get to see how willing God is to serve
    justice by seeing how even an apathetic judge
    eventually serves justice for the
    widow. (*Student Manual*)
	
	This parable also contains a lesson for
    leadership. As a leader, one has received
    authority from God and, if God wills it, will
    serve justice according to his position. Thus,
    even if we work in an imperfect system, with
    corruption and malice, we can know that the
    work of the Lord is always moving
    forward. (*Bible Gateway*)
  * **Luke 18:9-14** - I love this verse because
    of the fearless denunciation of the Pharisees'
    hypocrisy. He puts the publican, one of the
    most despised people, above the Pharisee,
    because of his humility and desire to become
    better. Though Pharisees were often highly
    esteemed in the community, they were not very
    receptive to Christ's teachings, and they
    often rejected them. Though they *pretended*
    to be obedient to the law, in reality, they
    were doing everything for show. (*Student
    Manual*)
