### Notes
  * I found it interesting how Christ asked two of
    his disciples to simply walk up and take a
    donkey. That required a lot of faith from his
    disciples on one hand. They had to have faith
    that they wouldn't get punished for
    stealing. The owner, on the other hand, also 
  * The leaves of the fig tree that Christ cursed
    showed that it should have been bearing
    fruit. However, it didn't have any fruit. You
    shouldn't *pretend* to be doing something,
    when in your heart, you have no desire to
    actually do it.
	
	Also, Jesus is the God of Justice, and he will
    have to smite some in the last day who aren't
    willing to follow his commandments. It was
    better that he demonstrate this on a tree than
    on an actual person.
  * The spikenard that Mary used, as well as the
    anointing of the head *and* the feet, indicate
    a great honor, usually only given to kings,
    and rarely at that. Mary may have known that
    Christ was going to be buried soon, and acted
    accordingly.
