### Notes
  * **Matthew 8:8** - This centurion had the faith
    for his servant to be healed, so much so that
    he didn't even need some physical
    manifestation. His faith was so great that he
    knew that if Jesus just gave the word, he
    would be healed. He knew that Christ was the
    commander of all, that everything obeyed
    him. This is the kind of faith that works
    miracles. And it's by this faith that the
    power of the priesthood works. The priesthood
    sans faith is powerless.
  * **Faith Is Not by Chance, but by Choice**
	* How does the Savior see my faith?
	* Faith is a principle of power
	* "My faith grew, allowing me to overcome
      challenges"
    * We can no longer stand on neutral ground -
      our faith either grows or it dies
  * **Matthew 8:20** - Christ never really had
    anywhere to rest, no where to call home. He
    often was relying upon others and was
    sometimes even rejected by others. This
    rejection was something that happened
    throughout his whole life. Yet he warmly
    welcomes others with outstretched arms. He is
    willing to accept anyone and everyone as they
    are. What a cool contrast between how others
    treated him and how he treats others.
  * **Matthew 12:25-26** - When a people is
    divided against itself, they will not
    survive. Satan wants a people to be
    divided. Zion, on the other hand, is "of one
    heart and one mind". Also, this is why Satan
    will never win. Ultimately, his principles are
    the opposite of God's. Even if his followers
    coordinate a little bit, eventually, they will
    fall into distrust and self-interest, which
    hinders progression. It is only in following
    the principles of God that will help us to
    progress to reach our potential.
