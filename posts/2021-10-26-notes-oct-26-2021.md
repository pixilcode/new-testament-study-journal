### John
One of the twelve apostles

Potential eye-witness for many experiences

Brother of James

"Sons of thunder"

Fisherman

Stays on earth until Second Coming

Wrote a Gospel, 3 epistles, and the Book of
Revelation

One of the last contributers to the Bible

Purpose is to testify that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God, so that we can find salvation in
his name

Not in the synoptic gospels

Likes to use symbolism/dualism

No true parables

Jesus teaches through dialogues

Mostly focused on Judean ministry

Audience: members of the church

#### Structure

1:1-18 - Prologue

1:19-12:50 - Signs (Semeia)* & Teachings
  * Semeia - uses miracles to show deeper
    understanding of

-_-_-

Three-year ministry (three passovers)

#### Style
Listeners misunderstand what Jesus says, Jesus
explains more.

Uses antagonists ("the Jews") to pose problems

Uses extended dialogues

Uses the term "world" 80 times - what is John
trying to teach about the world?

Uses *light* and *life* in the beginning, *love*
in the end

### Prologue of John
Close connection with Genesis

### Word/Logos
Greek word for "word" is *logos*

### Docetism

#### Nicodemus

#### Samaritan Woman
