### Notes
  * **Perspectives from each book** - Each book
    provides a different perspective of Christ's
    resurrection.
	* **Matthew (Israelite)** - talks about an
      angel descending from heaven to roll away
      the stone from Jesus' tomb
    * **Mark (straightforward, powerful)** -
      Joseph of Arimathea, a powerful member of
      the Sanhedrin courageously comes to ask for
      Jesus' body, the women are afraid at the
      tomb of Jesus
    * **Luke (humanitarian, public)** - one of the
      robbers is invited to paradise with Jesus,
      the crowd beats their breasts, other women
      were at the tomb
    * **John (eternal, divine)** - Jesus says "it
      is "finished" (or "perfected"), Jesus tells
      Mary not to touch him until he has ascended
      to heaven
  * **Matthew 28:20** - Before this moment,
    Christ's ministry was only to the
    Jews. However, in these verses, Christ gives
    the directive to his disciples to preach to
    "all nations"
