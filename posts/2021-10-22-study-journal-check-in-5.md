### Have you used your scripture journal with each bloc of reading in Luke 12-19:27?
Yes

### What are two additional resources that have enhanced your study?
I've used the *New Testament Student Manual* and
*Bible Gateway*.

### Share one insight that you have gained from your scripture study and/or from the additional resource.
One insight that I learned from my scripture study
was what we can learn from the parable of the
persistent widow. In *Bible Gateway*, it discusses
how we can all learn from this that we need to be
persistent in our pleading to God. We can't simply
ask once and hope it works out. We need to
seek out the Lord diligently with our needs.

However, what I really liked from this source was
a second perspective that it applied to this
parable. In comparing an imperfect, apathetic
judge to a perfect, loving God, we can learn more
about the justice of God. Even as we live in an
imperfect world with imperfect systems, we can
know that God's will will be done because those
that govern us, though imperfect, are governed and
given power by one who is greater: God. God will
make sure that everything happens the way it is
supposed to happen. Thus, even if we feel like we
are suffering injustice at the hands of others, as
the widow was, we can know that God hears our
pleas and will take care of us. He will ensure
that justice is served.

### How has this insight blessed your life or how have you applied what you learned?
This has given me comfort. In these times, there
is a lot of polarization happening, politically,
socially, and spiritually. Many are doing things
that are immoral and unjust. We see it on the news
every day. This worries me sometimes. I imagine
how it will affect me, my future family, and
others. It often feels like there isn't much
hope. However, knowing that God is in control
brings a lot of comfort. It's nice knowing that,
even though Satan is invading our every-day lives,
God won't ever let him have so much power as to
take away the justice and mercy of God. It makes
the future look that much brighter.
