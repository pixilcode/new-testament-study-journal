### Notes
  * **John 1:39, 46** Christ invites each of us to
    "come and see" the fruits of his Church. He
    invites us to come and gain a testimony of his
    divinity for ourselves. We each have the
    opportunity to learn for ourselves of the
    truthfulness of the gospel. However, we
    shouldn't stop there. Once we have our own
    testimony of the gospel, we need to go out and
    invite others to "come and see". We need to
    bring others to the fruit of the gospel.
