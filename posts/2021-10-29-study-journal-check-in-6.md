### Did you use your scripture study journal while reading John 1-7 this week?
Yes

### Share a picture from your journal this week (something that is not too personal). What was significant about this entry?

In this entry, I realized that sometimes, probably
more often than should be the case, I let
"traditions" get in the way of my fulfilling of
God's commandments. My ministering efforts
recently have been focused more on getting it
done than on caring for the person, which goes
completely contrary to the whole idea of
ministering. I need to focus more on the people
than I do on the task. The same thing goes for my
calling. My goal shouldn't be to simply get one
service project a month. It shouldn't be to have
the image of productivity. It should be planning
activities that help bring the ward closer
together and closer to Christ.

As a side note to that, I shouldn't be seeking
"honor" in my position either. I shouldn't be
looking for people to say, "Oh, he's the best
service co-chair ever!" I need to be seeking to do
the Lord's will in order to bless His children.

### Describe one additional resource that has enhanced your study and explain how.
*The New Testament Student Manual* put out by the
Church has really helped me to study. It gives
different perspectives on the reading that I
haven't thought about, such as the perspective
about Christ's teachings in the temple. It also
helps to explain some more confusing passages in
the scriptures, such as the passage describing the
"healing properties" of the pool of Bethesda. It
uses sources, both ancient and modern, that are
reliable and accurately reflect the teachings of
the Restored Church.
