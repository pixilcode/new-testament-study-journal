### Notes
  * **Matthew 5-6** - A lot of what he says is
    simply emphasizing the fact that God doesn't
    look on the outwardly appearance, He looks on
    the heart. If you're doing everything right,
    but you're dragging your feet at the same
    time, it's not going to profit you
    anything. If you're choosing the right so that
    everyone else will see you and see what an
    amazing person you are, you won't be rewarded
    for that. Lot's wife was obedient to the
    commandment to physically leave
    Sodom. However, she kept Sodom in her heart,
    which is why she looked back and turned to a
    pillar of salt.
  * **Matthew 5:29-30** - One great example of
    this is the Anti-Nephi-Lehis (see Alma
    24:17-18). They buried their only form of
    protection because they didn't want to shed
    blood. They saw that it was more important
    that they die on earth so that they could
    attain the Kingdom of God in heaven than that
    they retain their life here on earth, then be
    "cast into hell" in the eternities. And they
    *put their weapons of war out of reach*. It
    would be extremely difficult for them to
    retrieve their weapons and return to their old
    ways. Sometimes, if we need to get rid of
    something in our life, the best way to do it
    is to get as far away as possible from that
    thing. If we keep a temptation close and
    accessible, we are more likely to fall back
    into it. Sometimes distancing ourselves from
    the temptation comes with other
    difficulties. But it is more important that we
    deal with those difficulties than that we fall
    back into temptation.
  * **Matthew 5:33-37** - In the Old Testament,
    oaths are very important. Whenever one swears
    by the name of God or makes some other oath,
    that oath is binding. However, it seems that
    by the time of Jesus, people had begun to take
    oaths casually, taking out the meaning behind
    the oath. It's similar to today, when, for
    example, someone says, "Well I'll be damned if
    I don't have an answer to your question." In
    the Old Testament, this would have been an
    oath stating that if the person didn't have an
    answer to the question, they would be
    damned. However, nowadays, it's just a
    declaration of surprise. It has very little
    meaning. Thus, in order to avoid taking oaths
    casually, Christ told his disciples to simply
    say "Yea, yea; Nay, nay."
  * **Matthew 7:1-5** - "He that is without sin
    among you, let him first cast a stone" (John
    8:7). We shouldn't be condemning others in our
    own mind, while we have the same problem or an
    even bigger problem. God is the sole person to
    determine whether someone deserves forgiveness
    or not.
  * **Matthew 7:16-20** - What fruits am I
    producing?
	* Working hard at work
    * Homework getting in on time
    * Am I spending enough time with friends to
      show them the value of our relationship?
    * Am I staying in contact with my family?
    * Am I magnifying my calling?
    * How has faith, repentance, and the Atonement
      changed my life recently?
  * **Matthew 7:28-29** - Missionaries are given
    the authority to share the gospel by a prophet
    of God, sometimes, their doctrines "astonish"
    the people that they teach.
