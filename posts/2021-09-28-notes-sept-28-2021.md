### Calling of Apostles
Matthew was called from being a publican.

Jesus doesn't call us based on our occupation, he
calls us based on our discipleship within the
occupation.

"Apostle" is different from "Disciple"

"Apostle" indicates a chosen representative of
Christ

"Disciple" indicates a follower of Christ

### Conditions of Discipleship
**Matthew 10:34-39** - the Gospel that Christ
preached is divisive, even among families

It's not what Jesus wanted, but he knew it would
happen.

"He that loveth father or mother more than me is
not worthy of me."

Love God first, then love family

**Matthew 8:18-22** - our discipleship should be
more important than any other thing in our life

**Matthew 11-28-30** - heavy laden, take yoke upon
you

yoke /= rest

yoke = work, but work *together*

We get to work alongside Christ

See *The Inconvenient Messiah* by Jeffery R. Holand
