### Notes
  * **Matthew 1:21** - The name *Jesus* is a Greek
    form of *Yeshua* (*Joshua* in English), which
    means "Jehovah saves". This indicates the
    premortal identity and the foreordained
    mission of Christ.
  * **Matthew 1:23; Matthew 28:20** - Matthew
    both starts with mentioning a name of Christ,
    *Emmanuel*, which means *God with us*; and
    finishes with the statement "I am with you
    alway". This represents the message of
    Matthew, which is that God is with his
    people. He hasn't forgotten them.
  * **Matthew 3:16-17** - After Christ's baptism,
    he was publicly acknowledged as God's Only
    Begotten Son. Before then, he may have had
    only spiritual promptings. This may have been
    the pinnacle of a process of revelation.
  * **Matthew 4:1-2** - After his spiritual
    experience, he isolates himself in order to
    ponder on it.
  * **Matthew 4:3** - Satan tempts Jesus with
    hunger, but there's also a greater temptation:
    *if*. Satan wants Jesus to doubt whether He's
    really the Son of God. Christ's response to
    Satan's temptation is with scriptures.
