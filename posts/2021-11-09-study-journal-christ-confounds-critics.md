### Notes
  * **Render unto Caesar** - The Pharisees and the
    Herodians wanted to entrap Jesus. If he said
    that they should pay taxes, he would be seen
    as a traitor to the faith. If he said they
    shouldn't pay taxes, he could be branded as a
    rebel and could be put to death for
    insurrection. However, his response reflects
    the boundary between temporal and eternal
    jurisdiction.
  * **Marriage in Resurrection** - When the Savior
    is talking about marriage, he isn't saying
    that sealing isn't a bond for eternity. He's
    explaining that after resurrection, there
    won't be any marriages. It is an ordinance
    that must be done before the resurrection.
