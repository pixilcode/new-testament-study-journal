### Did you use your scripture study journal while reading Matt. 22:15-23:39; Matt. 24:1-26:35; Mark 12:13-44; Mark 13:1-14:31; Luke 20:20-22:38; John 12:20-50 this week?
Yes

### Share a picture from your journal this week (something that is not too personal). What was significant about this entry?

This entry is really cool because in this entry, I
made a connection between my two religion
classes. When we were talking about the covenant
made between Israel and God with Moses as the
officiator, Brother Seely kept mentioning how
Christ would come and fulfill the old "testament"
and give a new one. I'd forgotten about that, and
it was so cool to be reminded of it. It's been
such a great learning experience taking these two
classes side-by-side.

On a different note, in this entry, I was reminded
of the importance of preparation, as we discussed
in class. As I was reading the parable and I
stumbled upon the verse that talks about how "they
all slumbered and slept," I realized just how much
time they had to prepare. Then it struck me how much
time *I* have had to prepare. And how much time I
haven't spent preparing. This whole life is a time
to prepare to meet God. How much of it am I
wasting getting distracted by small, relatively
insignificant things?

### Describe one additional resource that has enhanced your study and explain how.
One resource that has enhanced my study, as
mentioned above, is my Old Testament religion
class that I'm taking right now. It's been so cool
to see how the two books of scripture are
intertwined, and often I hear you talk about
things that I'm learning in that class, or I hear
him teach about something that we've discussed in
class. It's awesome to be able to make those
connections.
