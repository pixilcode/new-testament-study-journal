### Did you use your scripture study journal while reading Matt. 26:47-28:20; Mark 14:43-16:20; Luke 22:47-24:53; John 18:1-21:25 this week?
Yes

### Share a picture from your journal this week (something that is not too personal). What was significant about this entry?

I found a really cool resource on the BYU studies website that compared the
gospels and discussed their different traits. In my notes, I only recorded
things pertaining to the resurrection, but it was really cool to see how
elements of each narrative reflect their style and tone of writing. Seeing how
these impacted the stories they told and how the told them really opened up my
mind. I began to see things from each Gospel that reflect each style of
writing.

### Describe one additional resource that has enhanced your study and explain how.
One resource that has really enhanced my study is *Enter the Bible*. From this
resource, I've been able to get a really cool perspective on how other religions
view similar experiences, such as Jesus' suffering on the cross and his
resurrection. It has helped me to expand my own thinking and consider the
scriptures from another point of view. For example, I never considered how
Matthew seems to attempt to counteract the statement of Mark, where the women
say nothing about their experiences to anyone. He shows how the women were
trying to convince the others of what they had seen, though nobody wanted to
listen to them. It shows how Christ values women just as much as men, and
sometimes He will reveal things to women that can't initially be perceived by
men.
