### Paraclete/Comforter
**FIND OUT FIVE THINGS OF HG**

The apostles didn't need the gift of the Holy
Ghost while Christ was with them.

peace. The HG lifts burdens, gives courage,
strengthens faith, grants consolation, extends
hope, and reveals what is needed.

### Last Supper
Strife over greatness - Christ resolves by washing
the feet of his apostles

"Lays aside his outer robe" - same as "lay down
his life" in Good Shepherd

Emphasizes equality - we are all a part of the
body of Christ, no calling is better than any
other

Something that happens in our day - apostle, time
and election made sure

#### Triclinium
Means "three couches"

![Triclinium](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.saymedia-content.com%2F.image%2Fc_limit%252Ccs_srgb%252Cfl_progressive%252Cq_auto%3Agood%252Cw_700%2FMTc2Mjg3NTMzMTU0NTEwMDE0%2Fthe-last-supper-portrait-is-in-error-based-on-scripture-and-history.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

Three couches around a table

Explains how John "leaned into Jesus' breast"

Also explains how not everyone heard him

#### Passover

**Four cups (Exodus 6:6-7):**
  * Sanctification
  * Judgment
  * Redemption
  * Praise

Sacrament is the culmination of Christ's feeding
miracles

"This is my body, here I am" - he took his body
all around and invited others to partake

"Behold what you are; become what you receive"

Uses "love" 6 times in John 1-12, 27 times(?) in
John 13-17

### Intercessory Prayer
Life eternal - that they might *know* thee

### Knowledge: *oida* vs. *ginosko*
Study vs. experience - *oida* vs. *ginosko*

How do I *know* him?

### True Vine
