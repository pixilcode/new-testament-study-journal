### Notes
  * **The Sabbath Day (Luke 13:11-17; 14:1-6)** -
    the Sabbath day is a day to "loose others from
    their infirmities." In other words, though it
    could technically be counted as working,
    service is permissible on the Sabbath day
    because it looses people from the grasp of
    Satan. It helps others to see their worth in
    the eyes of God and to come closer to Him.
  * **Luke 14:7-11** - it pays to be humble. It's
    better to underestimate your "position" and
    treat everyone else as greater than you
    because then others will help you to recognize
    your worth.
