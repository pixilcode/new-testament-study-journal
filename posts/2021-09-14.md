## Son of Man
The title that Jesus uses for himself (found
around 80 times). No one else uses it until after
his ascension. Why?

* Showing his relation to the 'Man of Holiness'
  (God)
* Refers to Daniel's prophecies
* Dual title
  * Identifies himself as 'mortal'
  * Identifies himself as the Messiah
  * Aspects of both *mortal* and *immortal*
  
## Jairus/Woman with the Issue of Blood

> "Reading the Scriptures", Nov. 1979

Jairus' life was changed by the little contact
that he had with Jesus. Our lives can also be
changed by our contact with him.

"If you can lay hands on her, she shall live."
Whatever Jesus lays his hands on will live.

"And Jesus went with him." Even though it wasn't
on the program.

### [The Touch](https://studentfilms.byu.edu/?p=2812)
Focus on what this event means to the woman,
and what were possible reactions of those who
witnessed it.
  * Apostles
  * Village residents
  * Members of the crowd accompanying Jesus
  * Jairus
