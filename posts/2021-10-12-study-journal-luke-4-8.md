### Notes
  * **Luke 4:2, 4** - One thing that struck as I
    was reading this section was that, although
    Jesus fasted for forty days, he didn't fast
    for his whole life. His life wasn't a life of
    complete self-deprivation. He still tended to
    the needs of his physical body. When he
    responded to Satan's temptation, he didn't say
    "man shall not live by bread *at all*," he
    said that "man shall not live by bread
    *alone*". Thus, even as we are striving to
    follow God, we don't need to avoid everything
    that is even remotely related to the world. We
    can live off "bread", but we also have to be
    living off of the word of God.
