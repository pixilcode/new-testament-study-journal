The book of Matthew was written for a Jewish
audience. In his book, he often shows the division
between "their synagogue" and "the church".

Theoretically, Matthew has two main sources from
which he likely drew:
  1. **The Gospel of Mark** - the chronology of
     Matthew reflects the chronology of
     Mark. Matthew contains more-easily understood
     wording for some phrases in Mark. Probably
     used by Luke.
  2. **Q** - a hypothetical document that contains
     the sayings of Christ. This was likely used
     by Luke as well.

However, it is important to recognize that Jewish
culture in the first century was very much orally
based.

### Matthew as Editor

Matthew used a couple techniques in his Gospel to
emphasize what he likely saw as important for his
audience, the Jews.

#### Matthew's five discourses of Jesus

In his attempt to portray Jesus as the new Moses,
he outlined five major discourses by Jesus:
  1. The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7)
  2. The Apostolic Commission (Matthew 10)
  3. The Kingdom of God Discourse (Matthew 13)
  4. The Church Administration Discourse (Matthew
     18)
  5. The Eschatological Discourse (Matthew 24-25)

He ends each of these with "And it came to pass,
when Jesus had ended these" sayings, teachings,
or parables, except the last one, where he says
"And it came to pass, when Jeus had finished *all*
these sayings."

In using these five discourses, Matthew's intent
may have been to create a Christian Penteteuch to
emphasize Jesus as the new Moses.
