#### How has this assignment been going for you overall? What effects (positive or negative) have you seen from this assignment?
This assignment has been going pretty well. It's
been pretty cool to see how often I actually get
promptings. I've started to notice promptings that
aren't specifically "spiritual", but that help my
day to go that much better. And I've felt that as
I've listened to the promptings, it's gotten
easier and easier to notice them. It's also helped
me to spend my time a lot more wisely. (See below)

#### What aspects of your life do most of your promptings seem to be pointed towards (school, friends, work, etc.)?
Most of my promptings are pointed towards time
management and planning. Sometimes, I feel like I
need to stop what I'm doing (whether it's
homework, reading, or relaxing) and do something
else. Sometimes, I'm reminded of an assignment
coming up (such as a spiritual prompting write-up)
and I figure out the best time to do it so that
I'm not procrastinating it. And sometimes I feel
like I just need to do... nothing. This has really
helped me to balance the different aspects of my
life so that I don't get overwhelmed in one area
and starve myself in another.

#### Have you followed up on the to-do promptings you wrote to yourself?
Yes.

#### Are there any experiences thus far youâ€™d be willing to share?
One experience that I've had was at work. I had a
test that I needed to go take after work. The
lines for the testing center the previous day had
been very long, and I was worried that I wouldn't
have time to take the test, so I wanted to get to
the testing center as soon as possible after
work. However, one of my coworkers needed someone
to cover her so she could go take a short test
with her friend, who was only available at that
time. So, although everything inside of me told me
that I needed to get out of there, I was prompted
to stay and cover for an extra half hour.

When she came back, I left work as quickly as
possible and pulled out my phone to check the
lines. To my surprise, the line was nearly
non-existent. I was able to get into the line
quickly and without a problem. On top of that, the
test didn't take as long as I had anticipated. It
was great to have the opportunity to serve someone
else, and I felt like the Lord compensated for
what I thought I was losing.

#### If you could make one change to how you have been tracking spiritual promptings for this assignment thus far, what would it be? (and will you do it?)
I need to get better at writing them down as soon
as I follow them. Sometimes, I identify them and
follow them, then tell myself that I'll write them
down later. Later comes and I can remember telling
myself that I'd write it down, but I can't
remember what it actually was. So I definitely
need to get better at writing them down immediately.
