### Have you used your scripture journal with each bloc of reading in John 13-17; Matt. 26:36-46; Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46?
Yes

### What are two additional resources that have enhanced your study?
*Enter the Bible* and *Feast Upon the Word*

### Share one insight that you have gained from your scripture study and/or from the additional resource.
As I was studying John 14, I came across his
promise to send his disciples "the Comforter" or
the Holy Ghost. It reminded me of the different
roles of the Holy Ghost. He is a comforter and a
teacher, and he can help us to remember the things
that we need in the moment that we need them. Each
of these things are things that everyone needs,
especially college students. And the promise isn't
just that he'll help us in our *religion*
classes. It's in everything. If you are struggling
in a class, he can help. If you are having trouble
with your roommates, he can help.

### How has this insight blessed your life or how have you applied what you learned?
As I was reminded of this, I began to look for
where I could use his help more in my life and ask
for it. I feel like it's already helped me,
especially as I'm studying for finals.  I've had
instances where even though I didn't feel like a
study session was very effective, I was able to
remember just enough to get me through a
test. It's been really cool to see the different
areas that the Holy Ghost has improved my life.
