### Notes
	* **John 13:34-35** - Interestingly enough,
      when talking to his disciples, Christ
      changes restates the "second greatest
      commandment," but with a twist. He states
      that they should love each other as *Christ*
      has loved them. He reminded them of his
      unconditional love for them and says that we
      should have that same unconditional love for
      others. We need to reflect the love of
      Christ onto others.
  * **John 14:6** - One of the seven "I am
    sayings", this emphasizes the importance of
    his role here on the earth. There is no other
    way to get to heaven except through his
    sacrifice. We are all separated from God by
    the gulf of our sins. Christ is the only
    bridge over that gulf.
  * **John 14:26** - One of the important roles of
    the Holy Ghost is to bring the "words of
    truth" to our remembrance, as well as to teach
    us new truths. He is the source of all truths,
    and should be included in our studies, even in
    more secular areas like math.
