### Notes
  * **Matt. 26:41** - This could be read as Christ
    chastising his disciples or expressing empathy
    for them. It also could have the double
    meaning of talking about the state of Christ,
    being willing in spirit to follow the will of
    the Father, but struggling in his mortal self
    with going through with the Atonement.
