### Notes
  * **John 5:2-4** - Apparently, according to
    Bruce R. McConkie, the pool of Bethesda didn't
    actually have healing powers. How were people
    being healed? Where they being healed? Why did
    they keep going if they weren't actually being
    healed?
  * **John 5:18** - Christ declared himself equal
    with God in declaring God as his father. This
    was either true or it was complete
    blasphemy.
  * **John 5:39** - What is our purpose for
    reading the scriptures? It is to gain a
    testimony of Jesus Christ. It is as we search
    the scriptures that we can gain that testimony
    of Christ. If we don't search the scriptures
    diligently, we won't recognize Christ at the
    last day.
  * **John 5:41-44** - We shouldn't be seeking
    honors from others, as that can blind us and
    lead us away from God. When we seek after
    glory here on Earth, we begin to lose sight of
    our eternal purpose, which is to return to God
    and to help others to return to Him.
  * **John 7:14-36** - Jesus taught well,
    especially without having deeply studied
    Jewish traditions and theology like some of
    the Rabbis. However, he didn't teach their
    doctrine, either. They had become layered in
    traditions, with many surface-level actions
    obfuscating the true meaning of the law that
    was given to them. When Christ taught, his
    teachings angered the Jews. He didn't conform
    to their fabricated traditions, instead
    pointing them to the true meaning of the
    law. He showed them what it *truly* means to
    keep the Sabbath day holy, or to love God and
    one's neighbor.
	
	In the same way, sometimes we let *our*
    traditions get in the way of God's
    laws. Sometimes, we care more that we
    completed our once-a-month home teaching visit
    than that the person was actually ministered
    to. Sometimes we care more about getting
    *food* to the activity than we do about
    getting *people* to the activity. Just like
    Christ mentioned in chapter 5, we shouldn't
    let anything, from earthly honor to
    traditions, get in the way of carrying out
    God's plan for His children.
