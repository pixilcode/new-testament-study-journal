### Did you use your scripture study journal while reading Luke 4-11 this week?
Yes.

### Share a picture from your journal this week (something that is not too personal). What was significant about this entry?
As I was reading in this section of Luke, I had a
really cool experience of seeing things in a new
light. Specifically, though I didn't *write* a lot
for Luke 10:13, that verse led to me making really
cool connections. As I was reading, I realized
that when Christ is condemning the cities where
he's done miracles, he is giving real life
examples of the Parable of the Sower. The seed, in
this case, is his miracles and the word he
preached. However, all of the seeds that he
planted seemed to fall on stony ground, where they
couldn't take root. However, if he'd planted it in
other cities, the seeds would have landed on more
fertile ground. Then, I thought about Laman and
Lemuel, and their many experiences with receiving
"signs" (such as an angel). However, their hearts
were stony ground. Thus, the "seeds" that were
planted in their hearts never took root for long,
leading to rebellion against God.

It was super cool to make all these connections
from my reading. It definitely helps me to want to
feast more on the word of Christ. It gives me
motivation to keep going with my studies
(something which can be lacking at times...).

### Describe one additional resource that has enhanced your study and explain how.
Bible Gateway has given me an interesting
perspective. It contains writings from those
outside the Church, which has helped me to see
things in a different light. Until I began to look
into this, I didn't realize how much of what I
observe in the scriptures, a lot of my
interpretations, come from the Latter-Day Saint
culture. There's certain ideas that are presented
and repeated within the culture, or certain
interpretations that are (unintentionally) put
forward as *the* interpretation.

For example, when we look at Jesus feeding the
five thousand, often we look at it as a miracle
that shows his power and his compassion for those
that he is teaching. However, from my readings in
Bible Gateway, I realized that this story was also
about Christ giving his apostles a chance to use
their talents to involve themselves in serving
others. That is something that I have never
thought of before. But it helped me to realize how
much God gives *us* the opportunity to serve when,
in all reality, he could do it himself if he
wanted to.
