Yes

### What are two additional resources that have enhanced your study?
The *New Testament Student Manual* and *Jesus the Christ*

### Share one insight that you have gained from your scripture study and/or from the additional resource.
One thing that I learned this week was about the
faith that is required of us as we follow
Jesus. When Jesus was preparing to enter into
Jerusalem, he needed a donkey upon which he could
ride. So he asked two of his disciples to go and
retrieve one for him. However, he didn't send them
with money or any other form of compensation. He
simply told them to go and take it and to tell the
owners that "the Master needs it."

As I was reading, I realized that that likely
required a lot of faith. I know that if I were in
their situation, I probably would have protested,
at least a little bit. "We can't just go *take*
someone's donkey. That's not right. What will I
say to them. What if they don't want me to take
it? What can I give them to pay for it? What if I
get arrested and have to suffer for it? You go do
it, Jesus, you're the one who wants it. If you're
so willing to risk all of that to get the donkey,
go put *yourself* on the line instead of *me*."

However, the disciples simply acted in faith. They
accepted the task Jesus gave to them and performed
it with exactness, not cowering when they
encountered the owners, not being afraid to be
obedient.

### How has this insight blessed your life or how have you applied what you learned?
I need to learn to be obedient with the exactness
with which those two disciples acted. They were
willing to follow what Christ said, even if they
were against it, even if they didn't understand
it, even if they were risking facing consequences
for it from men. They feared God more than they
feared men. I need to have that same sort of
fear. I need to be willing to simply *obey*, even
if I don't understand in that very moment. I need
to be willing to put everything on the line for
Jesus, and by extension, his prophets, in order to
prepare the way for him. I'm not the best at that
right now, but it is something that I can commit
to improving over time.
