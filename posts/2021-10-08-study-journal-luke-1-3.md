### Rel 211 Independent Study Assignment
*Luke 1-3*

This assignment has two parts. First read all the reading (Luke 1-3) for the
assignment. In the first set of questions, answer the questions based on your
reading of the text alone. Share 3-4 sentences of your thoughts.

For the second set of questions, choose two you are interested in. Read the
associated article with the question, and then write one page (double-spaced)
about what you learned and how it helped you better understand the content in
the scriptures.


### Short Answer Questions:

1. **These chapters juxtapose the experience of Elizabeth & Mary. How do you
   think their experiences differed? Discuss their situations: age, marital
   status, fertility, life experience, etc. How do you think society reacted to
   them in their different situations?**
   
   For Elizabeth, the experience seemed to be one of open joy. She was already
   married, thus she didn't have to be worried of accusation of fornication,
   unlike Mary, who was a virgin at the time of conception. When Joseph found
   out that Mary was pregnant, his first reaction was that she had been
   unfaithful. He could have created a public spectacle of her, which would have
   resulted in her being stoned, though he kindly chose to "put her away
   privily". Thus, due to their marital status, Elizabeth's experience was more
   of a public experience, while Mary's experience was more of a private
   experience.
   
   These experiences were also different because of their age and
   experience. Elizabeth was much older than Mary and had much more experience
   in life. Therefore, when she found out that she was pregnant, she likely was
   less worried and more excited. Mary, on the other hand, was still young. She
   had very little life experience and may have felt like she wasn't prepared to
   raise a child yet, much less the Son of God.
   
2. **Why do you think Christ chose shepherds to be the recipients of a heavenly
   messenger announcing the birth of Jesus Christ? What was their place in
   society (elite, lowly, etc.?)  What does this tell us about God? Is there any
   symbolism to this?**
   
   Christ often spoke about "the first being the last" and "being humble like a
   child". He also referred to himself often as "the Good Shepherd." Thus, it
   would make sense that the first people to hear the message are those that are
   "meek and lowly." God isn't prideful. He doesn't need to be heralded by great
   kings and announced to the world like a celebrity. He wants to be welcomed by
   those that would most appreciate His coming. He wants those that are humble
   to welcome Him.
   
3. **The gospel of Luke spends more time than any other gospel on the
   perspectives of women in Christ’s life? What would we lose or not learn about
   if the Gospel of Luke did not include the accounts of Elisabeth, Mary, and
   Anna? How do you think this lack of knowledge would change our perspective of
   these events?**
   
   In these events, though the men experience this story, the women have a much
   more intense and involved experience than the men. Elisabeth and Mary are
   physically connected with these experiences because they have to carry the
   babies. They also might have the greatest amount of wonder because they know
   first hand that what has happened should have been impossible. They know that
   God worked a miracle with them. Without their first-hand account, there could
   be some doubt as to whether it truly was a miracle, or whether what they had
   told the men was just a story to cover up something else, especially in the
   case of Mary.
   
   With the story of Anna, we get to see how she devoted her life to the Lord,
   even after the death of her husband. She served often in the temple and even
   obtained the gift of prophecy. Thus, for her sacrifice, she received the
   blessing of seeing Christ and prophesying of her future. We can draw from
   this that if we devote our lives to serving God, we can also receive a
   confirmation of the divinity of Jesus Christ.
   
4. **Share 2 verses from today’s reading that stood out to you and explain
   why.**
   
   In this section, Luke 3:10-14 really stood out to me. In these verses, people
   come to John and ask what they should do. John responds to each group, giving
   them counsel that applies specifically to them. Later, it also talks about
   how John called out Herod for having married his brother's wife. As I read
   this, though I'd heard it before, I began to truly internalize the fact that
   John's mission truly was to teach repentance—and he wasn't shy about it. This
   clarity is important, and it reminds me that, even though it may seem like
   the prophets speak critically sometimes, they are always simply calling us to
   repentance, and we would do well to listen.
   
   I also thought it was interesting in Luke 2:19, 50-51. In these verses, Mary
   has just heard or experienced something that she may not have
   understood. Her reaction to this is to "keep all these things, and ponder
   them in her heart." Sometimes, we encounter things that we may not
   understand, whether it be in the scriptures, General Conference, or even in
   school. When we do, we should follow the example of Mary and "keep all these
   things, and ponder them in our hearts." This will help us to increase our
   understanding over time, until we reach a fullness of understanding.
   
   
### Essay Answer Questions (Choose two and read associated supplemental text): 

5. **Samson, Samuel, & John the Baptist were all Nazarites. Read the associated
   article. What do these men have in common? What did they do differently? How
   did they prepare the world for a Savior? What did you learn overall from the
   article?**
   *[https://sharperiron.org/article/samson-samuel-john-and-birth-of-jesus](https://sharperiron.org/article/samson-samuel-john-and-birth-of-jesus)*
   
   One thing that I found interesting in this article was the fact that each of
   them were predecessors for a king. Samson and Samuel prepared the way for
   King David, while John the Baptist prepared the way for Jesus, King of
   Heaven and Earth. However, while they did effectively prepare the way, they
   never lived to see the success of their efforts. Samuel died before David
   even became king, and neither Samuel nor Samson lived to see the success of
   David over the Philistines. In the same way, John prepared people to hear the
   gospel of Jesus Christ. However, he was killed before Christ fulfilled his
   ministry in overcoming death and sin. Thus, though each of them prepared the
   way, none of them lived to see the end result.
   
   Now, while John and Samson were similar in some ways, they were very
   different in their level of righteousness. Samson was very casual in his role
   as a Nazarite. He had little respect for the commandments of God, and even
   ended up marrying outside of the covenant, which was his downfall. John, on
   the other hand, was very righteous, to the extent that he became, as Jesus
   claimed, one of the greatest prophets. In fact, his righteousness was so
   great that there are some that believe that John *was* the Messiah, and thus
   they reject Jesus Christ.
   
   What I've learned from this is that Nazarites (from birth) seem to dedicate
   their lives to preparing the way for someone who is greater than them. This
   could be a temporal preparation, like Samson when he destroys many of the
   Philistines; or it could be a spiritual preparation, like Samuel when he
   anoints David, or John, when he teaches the people repentance. Their lives
   weren't specifically easy. They had to abstain from the "fruit of the vine",
   which included grapes, raisins, and wine; they had to avoid cutting their
   hair; and they had to avoid dead creatures. Most importantly, they lived a
   life dedicated to God.
   
6. **Observe some images of the Madonna Enthroned. Read the associated
   article. What symbolism is present in these paintings? How were they a tool
   to teach about Christ? Why do you think they have been such a prominent type
   in art across styles & eras for so long?**
   *[https://mymodernmet.com/madonna-and-child-art-history/](https://mymodernmet.com/madonna-and-child-art-history/)*
   
7. **In the baptismal account, it states that the Holy Ghost descended like a
   dove. Read the associated article. What do you think this symbolism
   represents? What did the article teach you about the meaning of this
   scripture?** *[see PDF on Christian Symbolism]*
   
   I found it interesting in this article how when it talked about the symbol of
   the dove, it made reference to the time of Noah and the flood. Noah sent out
   the dove to see if there was dry land, and the dove came back with an olive
   branch. The flooding of the earth could be considered to be the "baptism" of
   the earth, with the dove as a representation of the completion of the
   cleaning process. It was a symbol of the earth's purity. In the same way, the
   dove that appeared at Christ's baptism could have been a symbol of the
   cleansing power of baptism. It represents the pure nature that comes with
   baptism, and it represents the peace of a life cleaned from sin.
   
   From this symbolism from Christ's baptism, we can find meaning in our own
   baptism. Often, we associate the descent of the Holy Ghost with the reception
   of the gift of the Holy Ghost. While that could be an accurate
   interpretation, we can also understand the nature of the dove as a symbol. It
   represents our own purity as we leave the waters of baptism. It represents
   its renewing power, its ability to clean us of all our sins, its ability to
   bring us peace. This can bring a whole new level of understanding and meaning
   to our experience with baptism (both for ourselves and others).
   
8. **Why was it important that Christ’s entire lineage be given? Read the
   associated article. What did you learn about the lineage of Jesus from this
   article? What questions did it answer for you?** *[see PDF on Genealogy of
   Jesus in Luke]*
