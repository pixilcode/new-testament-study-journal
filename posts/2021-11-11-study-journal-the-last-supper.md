### Notes
  * **Luke 22:20** - "This cup is the new
    testament in my blood, which is shed for you."
    This makes reference to the old testament, or
    covenant, that was made with the Israelites by
    Moses. After declaring the covenant, Moses
    took the blood of a sacrifice and sprinkled it
    on the people. Christ is now presenting a new
    covenant, and the ordinance that is related is
    the sacrament, where we drink the "blood" of
    Christ.
  * **Matthew 25:1-13** - As Christ is talking
    about the Second Coming, he tells a parable,
    the parable of the Ten Virgins. The virgins
    are evidently members of the church, as they
    know about the marriage. They all had plenty
    of time to get ready, to trim their lamps, and
    to get enough oil. They had so much time, they
    were even able to sleep! And yet, the five
    foolish virgins weren't ready when the time
    came. Because of that they lost the
    opportunity to join in the feast.
  * **Luke 22:10-13** - It's quite amazing how
    Christ just has to speak and it's done. He
    knows exactly where to find what he needs,
    including a room for the passover. I wish that
    I could do that... But on a more serious note,
    we know that Christ doesn't just use his power
    on a whim. He has a purpose for everything
    that he does. Thus, this feast was obviously
    very important. It was the moment during which
    Christ established the new covenant that was
    about to come to pass. He prepared his
    disciples with a new ordinance that they
    should perform in place of the old one to
    remind them of the new covenant.
