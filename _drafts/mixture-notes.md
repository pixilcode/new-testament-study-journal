### Mixtures

In the law of Moses, specifically in Leviticus 19:19, and again in Deuteronomy
22:9, the commandment is given to "not sow thy field with mingled seed"
(Leviticus 19:19). If one does so, "the fruit of thy seed which thou has sown,
and the fruit of thy vineyard, [will be] defiled" (Deuteronomy 22:9). Thus, one
cannot, for example, grow vegetables and wheat in the same field.

There are, however, some plants that can be grown together. The most well-known
example of this is wheat and tares. Tares, also known as "the bearded darnel",
are a species of rye-grass whose seeds contain a strong poison. It bears a
strong resemblance to wheat until the ear appears, at which point it is
differentiable ([Bible Study Tools: Tares]).

This example was a well-known example in the time of Christ for teaching about
the nature of mixtures, and it was likely that Christ was making
reference in his parable of the wheat and the tares ([TRENT]). Often, this
parable is interpreted in the context of good and evil. God allows good and bad
people to live together and interact. Sometimes the good suffer because of the
bad. However, in the end, all of the good will enter into the kingdom of heaven
while all of the evil will be burned. Thus everyone shall receive their
recompense.

While this may be a correct interpretation of the parable, those that listened
to the parable may have seen it from a different perspective based on their
knowledge of mixtures as taught by the Rabbis ([TRENT]). Christ spoke of the
kingdom of heaven in terms of a field. This field was sowed with wheat, which
was a good seed, what the owner wanted. Then, the enemy came and sowed the
field with tares, a potentially poisonous seed.

At this point, some may have wanted to completely abandon the field, while
others expressed their desire to immediately remove the tares from the field,
possibly in order to avoid having a mixture of plants growing together and
making the field impure.

The wise owner, however, recognized that in the process of uprooting the tares,
some of the wheat would be uprooted as well. He couldn't afford that to
happen. He also recognizes the two crops as mixtures that can grow together. So
instead he allows for the mixture to grow together until harvest time. It is at
that moment that he has the two plants separated and dealt with accordingly.

In this parable, God evidently is the owner of the field. He has sown seeds of
love and charity in his church. Satan has also sown seeds of contention and
malice. Because of this, some may want to completely abandon the church. Others,
like the Pharisees of Jesus' time, may want to eliminate any sign of "impurity"
at an early stage in order to avoid problems later. However, God, in his
infinite wisdom, has chosen to let all grow together, recognizing that it will
do more good than harm.

The Pharisees were often judgemental of those that were not a member of the
house of Israel. They looked down upon the Samaritan, for example, as
demonstrated during Christ's interaction with the woman at the well (John
4:9). If they were given charge over God's "field", they would have immediately
shunned anyone that they thought was a "tare", someone that would not obtain a
place in the kingdom of God. This meant that they would refuse to include anyone
that was not directly of the house of Israel. They wanted to avoid any kind of
"mixture". God, on the other hand, was willing to allow a mixture. He was
willing to let both the Jews *and* the Gentiles into the covenant, as evidenced
by the ministry of the apostles after Christ's death. Some of the Gentiles would
end up being "wheat", while some of the Jews would turn out to be "tares". But
that would not be evident until *after* they had shown their fruits. Thus, as a
part of this parable, Christ was showing the importance of welcoming everyone
into the kingdom of God. He showed that those of his church should not shun
anyone. Otherwise, they might uproot a stalk of wheat because they thought it
was a tare.

In other words, God has permitted that there be a mixture in His church. It is
only after they show their fruits that they shall be judged. And that judgment
only comes from God or from those appointed by him. Only they have the
revelation to know when the fruits are ripe.
