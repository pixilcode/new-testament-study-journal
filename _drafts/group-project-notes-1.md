### Traditions of the Rabbis from the Era of the New Testament: Vol. 1 (Prayer and Agriculture)

#### Harvest Leftovers for the Poor

##### Definitions
**Corner crops** - the corners of the crops should
be left over. In other words, let the poor harvest
whatever happens to be left after the harvest.

**Gleanings** - whatever the farmer dropped as he
was harvesting

**Forgotten produce** - produce that was left
after the season of harvest
